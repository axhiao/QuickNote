# QuickNote
Capture only what you want with Vision-Language(VL) Models.


In May 2024, Microsoft introduced [Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Recall), an ambitious attempt to help users remember everything they do on their PC. However, concerns around security and rigid system requirements quickly overshadowed its promise. **QuickNote** was born from a different idea: memory should be intentional. Instead of recording everything by default, QuickNote helps users capture and recall only what they choose to save. The goal is to help users quickly capture, organize, and retrieve important information.
